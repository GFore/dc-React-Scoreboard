## My First React Project! A Simple Scoreboard

Run from the project directory using `npm start`

The app opens with a default list of players and their scores.

### Buttons:
- click `X` to remove the player
- click `+1` to add 1 to the score
- click `-1` to remove 1 from the score
- click `Add Player` to add a new player (will be prompted for name and score)
- click `Reset` to reset to the original default list

## SMALL REACT EXERCISES

STRETCH:
- Click a timestamp to delete it
- Add a Reset button that clears list and adds current timestamp
